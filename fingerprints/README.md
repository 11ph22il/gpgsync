# Fingerprints File

If you'd like to test out GPG Sync before you create your own authority key and fingerprints file, you can use this one. In GPG Sync, create a new endpoint with the following settings:

* Authority Key Fingerprint: `A64237D7ADD17B2A51D8B8E870FE91BC9AD258AF`
* Fingerprints URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firstlookmedia/gpgsync/master/fingerprints/fingerprints.txt`

After syncing for the first time, your GPG keyring should contain a few new keys.
